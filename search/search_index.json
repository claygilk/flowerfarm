Each row is 4 feet by 100 feet There is 6ft between each row. This leaves room for driving equipment up and down the row, i.e. the gator Each row has three drip tape irrigation lines Two irrigation zones, each zone has 15 drip tape lines to cover 5 rows each zone Doing the math, each bed is 48 inches (4 feet) wide and 1200 inches (100 feet) long, as shown above, and by planting with 9-inch square spacing, I can fit 65 plants in each bed: width : 48in / 9in spacing = 5.3 plants; rounds down to 5 plants length : 1200in / 9in spacing = 133.3 plants; rounds down to 133 plants bed : 5 plants X 133 plants = 665 plants per row 665 plants per row Irrigation Reference for this section: dripworks planning guide Flow Knowing your flow rate is critical to sizing your system. I did a flow test with the spigot out in the field. It took about 55 seconds to fill 5 gallon bucket. I used the following formula to compute gallons per hour (GPH). Or you can use the flow calculator from dripworks.com 55 gal 60 sec 60 min 18,000 gal ------ x ------ x ------ = ---------- ~= 327 GPH 55 sec 1 min 1 hr 55 hr flow test: 55 seconds per 5 gallons that works out to 327 GPH Soil Type Next we need to know our soil type: Clay - requires a 0.5 GPH emitter Loam - requires a 0.5-1 GPH emitter Sand - requires a 1-2 GPH emitter In my case I am not sure, I will guess loam for now. Loam - requires a 0.5-1 GPH emitter (let's go with 0.75 GPH) Product Selection According to the description Drip Tape sounds best for my situation: Drip Tape is best for long, straight row crops. It is the most economical way to water your plants and is easy to install and maintain. To start I am going to buy a kit. There seem to be two kits that could do the job: drip tape row crop medium drip tape row crop large If I only use two strips of drip tape per row then I could get the medium kit. However, the medium kit leaves no room for error and I feel like I am my 9in spacing for the plants is denser than normal so I better go with at least three strips of drip tape per row. Given that I will get the large kit with an extra timer so I can automate two zones. I will be going with the drip tape row crop large kit","title":"Plan"},{"location":"spring2020/plan/#spring-2020-plan","text":"","title":"Spring 2020 Plan"},{"location":"spring2020/plan/#flower-field-layout","text":"Here is an overview of the field.
