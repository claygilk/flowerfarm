Dahlias They are considered a tender perennial in cold regions North America Extremely cold sensitive Dahlias brighten up any sunny garden with a growing season that\u2019s at least 120 days long Dahlias start blooming about 8 weeks after planting, starting in mid-July Choose a location with a bit of protection from the wind. seed vs tuber When to plant Plant when ground has warmed to 60\u00b0F, normally about 2 weeks after your last spring frost. May 7 How to plant Dig a hole that\u2019s about 4 to 6 inches deep Set the tubers into it, with the growing points, or \u201ceyes,\u201d facing up, and cover with 2 to 3 inches of soil (some say 1 inch is adequate). As the stem sprouts, fill in with soil until it is at ground level. Do not water the tubers right after planting; this encourages rot. Wait until the sprouts have appeared above the soil to water. Do not bother mulching the plants. The mulch harbors slugs and dahlias like the sun on their roots. Watering There\u2019s no need to water the soil until the dahlia plants appear; in fact, overwatering can cause tubers to rot. Once any foliage emerges from the ground, water deeply 2 or 3 times a week for at least 30 minutes. Nutrition Side dress with a complete granular fertilizer, such as 10-10-10, when tubers begin to sprout Liquid fertilizer (300-600 ppm N) once every 2 weeks Care Will require support (see corral method below) When plants are about 1 foot tall, pinch out 3-4 inches of the growing center branch to encourage bushier plants and to increase stem count and stem length. If you want to grow large flowers try disbudding\u2014removing the 2 smaller buds next to the central one in the flower cluster. This allows the plant to put all of its energy into fewer but considerably larger flowers. Bedding dahlias need no staking or disbudding; simply pinch out the growing point to encourage bushiness, and deadhead as the flowers fade. Pinch the center shoot just above the third set of leaves. For the taller dahlias, insert stakes at planting time. Moderately pinch, disbranch, and disbud, and deadhead to produce a showy display for 3 months or more. Pests/Diseases Slugs and snails are dahlias\u2019 number one enemy. Put down bait about 2 weeks after planting, or as soon as you see foliage emerging from the ground, and then periodically through the season. Sluggo is an organic option that\u2019s safe for both children and pets Mites: To avoid spider mites, spray beginning in late July and continue to spray through September. Speak to your garden center about recommended sprays for your area. Earwigs and Cucumber Beetle: They can eat the petals though they do not hurt the plant itself. Powdery Mildew: This commonly shows up in the fall. You can preventatively spray before this issue arises from late July to August. Harvest Cut the stems in the morning before the heat of the day and put them into a bucket with cool water. Remove bottom leaves from the stems and place the dahlias in a vase. Put the vase in a cool spot and check the water daily. The bouquet should last about a week. Dig up your dahlias before your hard frost. (10/5 is average first frost) After fall frost has blackened the foliage, cut off all but 2 to 4 inches of top growth. Carefully dig around tubers with a pitchfork (or shovel) without damaging them. Lift and gently shake the soil off the tubers. Cut rotten tubers off the clump and leave the clumps outside in the sun upside down to dry naturally Storing dahlia tubers Pack in a loose, fluffy material (vermiculite, dry sand, Styrofoam peanuts). Store in a well-ventilated, frost-free place\u201440 to 45\u00ba F is ideal, 35 to 50\u00ba F is acceptable. Re-planting tubers in spring Take out the tubers in the spring, separate healthy tubers from the parent clump, and plant in the garden. Each tuber must have at least one \u201ceye\u201d or a piece of the crown attached or it will not develop into a blooming plant. The eyes are located at the base of the stem and look like little pink bumps. Starting dahlias from seeds from gardeningknowhow.com/ Sow your seeds on the surface of the mixture and cover lightly with a dusting of the medium. Moisten the medium and keep moderately damp, moving the flats to a warm location of at least 70 degrees F. Germination will occur in 7 to 12 days after sowing. Once the seedlings are large enough that their leaves are touching, individually pot them up in 3-inch containers. Harden the seedlings off before planting them out into prepared garden beds. Wait to plant them outdoors until all danger of frost has passed. Alternatively, you can plant them outdoors a week before the date of the last frost. In northern climates this may not give the plants enough time to develop and bloom. If cold temperatures threaten at the end of summer, repot the plants and move them into a greenhouse or indoors. They won\u2019t have much tuber development and the best way to save them for next season is to let them go dormant indoors where icy temperatures can\u2019t damage the tiny root and tuber system. Harden them off the next season and plant outdoors. Support corral method - place a metal T-post every 10 feet along the outside of the beds and then stringing a double layer of baling twine from post to post to corral the plants in.","title":"Flowers"},{"location":"flowers/#flowers","text":"My notes on various flowers...","title":"Flowers"},{"location":"flowers/#dahlias","text":"They are considered a tender perennial in cold regions North America Extremely cold sensitive Dahlias brighten up any sunny garden with a growing season that\u2019s at least 120 days long Dahlias start blooming about 8 weeks after planting, starting in mid-July Choose a location with a bit of protection from the wind. seed vs tuber","title":"Dahlias"},{"location":"flowers/#when-to-plant","text":"Plant when ground has warmed to 60\u00b0F, normally about 2 weeks after your last spring frost.

On average, your frost-free growing season starts Apr 11 and ends Oct 30, totaling 202 days Spring 2020 in Northern Hemisphere will begin on Thursday, March 19 Flower Field Layout Reference: dripworks planning guide growing with landscape fabric Each bed is 4 feet by 100 feet 10 beds total (5 beds in each irrigation zone) 2 feet between each bed with 6 feet between each zone Landscape fabric is 6 feet wide. This is enough to cover the beds and overlap in between to allow ~2 feet for a walking path 3 drip tape irrigation lines per bed 2 irrigation zones, each zone has 15 drip tape lines Spacing Plan To compute the number of plants per bed; each bed is 48 inches (4 feet) wide and 1,200 inches (100 feet) long, as shown above, and by planting with 9-inch spacing, I can fit ~665 plants in each bed: Plants per width : 48in / 9in spacing = 5.3 plants; rounds down to 5 plants Plants per length : 1200in / 9in spacing = 133.3 plants; rounds down to 133 plants Plants per bed : 5 plants X 133 plants = 665 plants per bed 665 plants per bed, that's 6,650 plants for the entire field Irrigation Setup Flow Knowing your flow rate is critical to sizing your system. I did a flow test with the spigot out in the field. It took about 55 seconds to fill 5 gallon bucket. I used the following formula to compute gallons per hour (GPH). Or you can use the flow calculator from dripworks.com 55 gal 60 sec 60 min 18,000 gal ------ x ------ x ------ = ---------- ~= 327 GPH 55 sec 1 min 1 hr 55 hr Flow Capacity: 327 GPH Soil Type Next we need to know our soil type: Clay - requires a 0.5 GPH emitter Loam - requires a 0.5-1 GPH emitter Sand - requires a 1-2 GPH emitter In my case I am not sure, I will guess loam for now. Loam - requires a 0.5-1 GPH emitter (let's go with 0.75 GPH) Product Selection According to the description Drip Tape sounds best for my situation: Drip Tape is best for long, straight row crops. It is the most economical way to water your plants and is easy to install and maintain. To start I am going to buy a kit. There seems to be two kits that could do the job: drip tape row crop medium drip tape row crop large If I only use two strips of drip tape per row then I could get the medium kit. However, the medium kit leaves no room for error and I feel like 9 inch spacing for the plants is denser than normal so I better go with at least three strips of drip tape per row. Given that I will get the large kit with an extra timer so I can automate two zones. In this blog post Floret says they use four strips of drip tape per four foot bed but they have sandy soil and even say that you could get by with two or three strips if you don't have sandy soil, so that validates my choice. I will be going with the drip tape row crop large kit Zones The drip tape that comes with the large kit uses drip tape part# TA1508L which is rated at Flow per 100 feet is 20 GPH . So that is 20 GPH for each strip of drip tape. I need 30 strips total for the field which would require 600 GPH (20 GPH X 30 strips), but my system can only generate 327 GPH. Therefore, if I split my field into two zone, 5 beds requiring 15 strips each, then each zone will only need 300 GPH (20 GPH X 15 strips) which is less than 327 GPH, so we are good. two zones, each requiring 300 GPH (20 GPH X 15 strips) Germination Station Shelf Layout The image below shows the layout for one shelf of the germination station. Each shelf will be able to hold 288 plants , four starter trays of 72 plants each. 288 plants per shelf Station Each station is a five shelf unit.

It is the most economical way to water your plants and is easy to install and maintain. To start I am going to buy a kit. There seems to be two kits that could do the job: drip tape row crop medium drip tape row crop large If I only use two strips of drip tape per row then I could get the medium kit. However, the medium kit leaves no room for error and I feel like 9 inch spacing for the plants is denser than normal so I better go with at least three strips of drip tape per row. Given that I will get the large kit with an extra timer so I can automate two zones. In this blog post Floret says they use four strips of drip tape per four foot bed but they have sandy soil and even say that you could get by with two or three strips if you don't have sandy soil, so that validates my choice.

So that is 20 GPH for each strip of drip tape. I need 30 strips total for the field which would require 600 GPH (20 GPH X 30 strips), but my system can only generate 327 GPH. Therefore, if I split my field into two zone, 5 beds requiring 15 strips each, then each zone will only need 300 GPH (20 GPH X 15 strips) which is less than 327 GPH, so we are good. two zones, each requiring 300 GPH (20 GPH X 15 strips)","title":"Zones"},{"location":"spring2020/plan/#germination-station","text":"","title":"Germination Station"},{"location":"spring2020/plan/#shelf-layout","text":"The image below shows the layout for one shelf of the germination station.
